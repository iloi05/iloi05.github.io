### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because was simple enough that I felt that coding was learnable for a complete beginner like me. Another reason why I really like this lab is that I learned how to format my code properly and read error messages. From this lab, I learned how to use std::cout properly. 

* Lab 2
    Lab 2, part 1 was another favorite since it involved math. It was enjoyable for me to type in the math operators for division, multiplication, and addition. This lab taught me how to use math operators when coding in the C++ language.

* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1 was a bit more challenging, but still one of my favorites because I started understanding how to read code a bit more. This lab was fun since I learned how to create a function that could do math that can be later used in main. This lab taught me how to call functions into main.
